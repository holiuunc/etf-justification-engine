# Econ 425 Investment Project Guidelines (Source of Truth)

This file contains the verbatim guidelines for the investment project. All strategies and application logic should be designed to meet these requirements.

---

### Overview
The project over the end of the course is to manage a small investment company. To that end, you will take on the role of asset researchers and managers. You will manage a fake portfolio of $100,000 over the remainder of the course with the objective of ultimately maximizing your return. How you do so, is entirely up to you.

The project is a group project where you and 5 (or 6) other individuals who you have either chosen or been assigned to help you will come together to do macro level, industry level and asset level analysis. Using that analysis, you will engage in trading to actively manage a portfolio throughout the end of the course. You will be limited to 25 different ETFs that mimic a variety of industries, asset markets, or international market returns.

Three times, at the beginning, the middle, and the end of the project period, you will give an investment prospectus. What this looks like is an overview of your analysis from the macro perspective to industry/market perspective and then ultimately your investment strategy as well as a summary of the current holdings of your assets. Any strategy that you decide on needs to be grounded in your analysis of the current market/industry situation. If you decide to change positions throughout the month and a half keep in mind that the reason for making a trade is more important than the trade itself and changing of that strategy should be detailed in the next prospectus.

### Instructions for Sign up
Each team (see team spreadsheet) should get together and first discuss roles and responsibilities within the group (I suggest breaking up the analysis and having each individual specialize in an area or areas). After that each team should sign up for the stock exchange website. It can be found at marketwatch.com/games. You will need to register for the site as a group. Then you will then want to click find game; this semester's game is called UNC Fall 2025 Econ 425. The actual link for the project will be posted on canvas as an announcement. The start date to begin trading will be Monday September 29th but you can place orders in before that they just won't execute until that date. The password to join will be ramses4ever.

### Trading Rules
You may trade as often as you like to and as much as you'd like to. You are not allowed to margin trade, nor are there partial share trades. You may only keep overnight at most 5% of your available balance as cash. (I want you to invest most of it but you can keep a little on hand if you are timing something). Keep in mind there is a $10 commission on each trade.

### Prospectuses
Prospectuses are due on Sep 29th, November 6th, and Dec 3rd(LDOC) via gradescope. Please make sure to give all your group members credit in the turn in. If you decide to cite a media source in your prospectus, please cite it properly via a footnote or works cited page. Plagiarism will not be acceptable and will result in a 0 for the prospectus. They should be no longer than 3 pages, though graphs, figures and tables if you would like to include them (such as a pie chart of the portfolio allocation) can go onto a separate page that do not count towards the limit. Prospectuses will be graded via the rubric attached.
