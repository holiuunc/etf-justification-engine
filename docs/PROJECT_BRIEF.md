### Overview
The project over the end of the course is to manage a small investment company. To that end, you will take on the role of asset researchers and managers. You will manage a fake portfolio of $100,000 over the remainder of the course with the objective of ultimately maximizing your return. How you do so, is entirely up to you.

The project is a group project where you and 5 (or 6) other individuals who you have either chosen or been assigned to help you will come together to do macro level, industry level and asset level analysis. Using that analysis, you will engage in trading to actively manage a portfolio throughout the end of the course. You will be limited to 25 different ETFs that mimic a variety of industries, asset markets, or international market returns.


### Trading Rules
You may trade as often as you like to and as much as you'd like to. You are not allowed to margin trade, nor are there partial share trades. You may only keep overnight at most 5% of your available balance as cash. (I want you to invest most of it but you can keep a little on hand if you are timing something). Keep in mind there is a $10 commission on each trade.
